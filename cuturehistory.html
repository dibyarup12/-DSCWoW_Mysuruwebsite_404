    <p align="center"><b>THE RICH CULTURE OF MYSORE</b><br>
      Mysore situated in Karnataka is a land with rich historical past. It has many pre-historic sites and most of
      them are in the river valleys. The district possess excellent fauna and flora, rivers, hillocks, lakes and a moderate
      climate. 
      The city with the majestic Mysore Palace, the royal mansions, public buildings, gardens,
      water bodies and planned markets exhibit an indelible impression of the vision of the Maharajas,
      their Dewans and other talented luminaries on the City Municipality as early as 1862. The total
      harmony of buildings, sites, lakes, parks and open spaces of Mysore and the back drop of
      Chamundi hill adds to city’s attraction.<br>

      <p align="center">HISTORY OF MYSORE<br><br><br>
       Mysuru served as the capital city of Kingdom of Mysore for nearly six centuries from 1399 to 1956. The kingdom was 
      ruled by Wadiyar dynasty. Their rule was disrupted by Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan in the eighteenth century. 
      But the Wodeyars were patrons of art and culture and promoted it significantly in the state. That was the reason 
      the city earned the sobriquet of cultural capital of Karnataka. Mysuru palace, where it stands now, was once occupied 
      by a village named Puragere. The Mahishuru fort was constructed in 1524 by ChamarajaWodeyar III. It took almost a 
      century for the kingdom to become a sovereign ‘state’. In the 17th century, Wodeyar expanded their territory and annexed 
      large parts of territory what is now known as southern Karnataka and parts of Tamilnadu to become a powerful state in 
      southern Deccan. In the latter half of the 18th century, the kingdom reached the height of its military power under 
      the aegis of the ruler Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan. During this period, the kingdom came into conflict with Marathas, 
      the British and the Nizam of Golconda. It led to four wars. After Tipu Sultan’s death in fourth Anglo-Mysore wars, the British 
     distributed the kingdom to their allies. The former Wodeyar rulers were reinstated as puppet monarchs.Mysuru lost its status as
      administrative capital in 1831 when British commissioner moved the capital to Bengaluru but regained it in 1881. It remained the
   capital till India became independent in 1947.<br>

     Over the years Mysore has become a cosmopolitan city with people from different walks of life living together peacefully.
     In Mysore people practicing different faiths live harmoniously. This has helped the city develop. The people of Mysore take part 
    in each other's festivals and celebrations. The Kings of Mysore have laid a strong foundation for communal harmony by making generous 
     contributions towards religious centers of all religions. This tradition is still followed in Mysore.<br><br>
     The high point of the celebration in the olden days was the "Jamboo Savari" or the procession of the Maharaja on elephant back
     through the streets of Mysore. It is said that Dasara was celebrated in this manner from the times of the epics and was continued
     by all the Kings of Mysore. Even today Dasara is celebrated with the same pomp and splendor with some minor changes. Now the Royal Elephant
     carries the golden idol of Goddess Chamundhi in the splendid procession through the streets of Mysore. Though Mysore has become a modern city 
     and has all the comforts of modern development, this city has managed to retain all its old world charm.<br>
