      them are in the river valleys. The district possess excellent fauna and flora, rivers, hillocks, lakes and a moderate
      climate. 
      The city with the majestic Mysore Palace, the royal mansions, public buildings, gardens,
      water bodies and planned markets exhibit an indelible impression of the vision of the Maharajas,
      their Dewans and other talented luminaries on the City Municipality as early as 1862. The total
      harmony of buildings, sites, lakes, parks and open spaces of Mysore and the back drop of
      Chamundi hill adds to cityâ€™s attraction.
