         Jaganmohan Palace has a unique place in the list of Mysore tourist places and is one of the seven palaces of this royal city. This 19th-century Hindu-style palace was built when a fire broke out and destroyed the old 
        Mysore Palace and served as the residence of the royal family when the new palace was being constructed.

       Another prominent edifice in Mysore, perhaps the only British structure in the city, is the St. Philomena’s Cathedral. The church, which is one of 
      the tallest in Asia, was erected to honor St. Philomena, a Catholic saint. Before the church was constructed, 
      there used to be a small church in the same location, which was built by Maharaja Mummadi Krishnaraja Wodeyar for the increasing number of Europeans.
